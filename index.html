  {artist:"Al Bano & Romina Power", title:"Domani Domani", text:`Bar di periferia
C'è gente che ormai
Offre solo fobia
E ormai non si sa
Se avere pietà
O chiudersi il cuore
Qui l'impegno è un'idea
Si vive in apnea
Tra dubbi e rancore
È un viaggio nel peggio
Ma c'è chi dirà

Domani, domani
Finiscono i guai
Ci fanno promesse
Ma sempre le stesse
Domani, domani
Parola del mai
E intanto affonda
Lo stivale nel fango
Aspettando domani
Vedrai che domani

Qui si va sulla luna
Ma invece in tribuna
C'è chi rischia la pelle
Qui funziona il caffè
La mamma è ok
Ma poi tutto il resto?
Se giustizia è un'idea
Tu falla anche tua
Difendila sempre
Da chi ancora dirà
Le cose a metà

Domani, domani
Finiscono i guai
Ci fanno promesse
Ma sempre le stesse
Domani, domani
Parola del mai
E intanto affonda
Lo stivale nel fango
Aspettando domani
Vedrai che domani

Ma sul pozzo del tempo
Ai piedi del monte aspetterò
Per stringere tra le mie mani
Un nuovo domani

Domani, domani
Nel sole verrà
La voce di un uomo
Dimenticato
Domani, domani
Più giusto sarà
Il mondo avrà il cuore
Che hai sempre sognato

Aspetta domani
Domani, domani
Soltanto domani
Domani, domani`, image:"IMG_7281.jpeg"},

  {artist:"And One", title:"Sometimes", text:`Daddy said that I′m a good boy,
'cause I always did his will,
but I can′t remember,
was it me? How did I feel?

I call them family,
but in the heart of hearts I know,
there's something wrong with me,
What can I do?

Mother said that I'm a good girl,
I was always dressed to kill,
but I can′t remember,
was it me? How did I feel?

Now this is long ago,
but today I′m really sure,
I don't wanna crawl no more.
No, I don′t want to!

I want to be all alone
to be all alone
(leave me all alone, I'm so lonely)
Sometimes I don′t know what I prefer to be
(that's all that I can see)

So I burnt down the house of hate,
the key to close the door,
what a nice September,
I found out it′s not too late.

It happened yesterday,
but today I'm really sure,
I don't wanna crawl no more.
No I don′t want to!

I want to be all alone
to be all alone
(leave me all alone, I′m so lonely)
Sometimes I don't know what I prefer to be

  {artist:"Annalisa", title:"Bellissima", text:`Insieme solo dentro casa, che senso ha?
Di me non parli con nessuno e non me lo merito
Il tuo modo di dire le cose, che sesso fa
Mi sto impegnando ad essere più elastica
Ti sto pensando e non ti scrivo da tanto, è un classico
E poi senza avvisare sei qui

Oddio però tu mi piaci, oh-oh-oh
Ho fatto i salti mortali, oh-oh-oh
No, non mi dire che è tardi, ah-ah-ah
Avevo voglia di vo-voglia di, voglia di

Dove vai? Te ne vai
Quella volta non dovevi andare via
Ero bellissima, bellissima
Dove vai? Ma che cosa vuoi?
Quella volta ti aspettavo in Saint Laurent
Ero bellissima, bellissima

Mettiamo un po' di musica da ginnastica
È tutto il giorno che mi salvo da un pianto isterico
Vado a letto col pantaloncino dell'Adidas
E poi volevo dirti che non ci dormo più
Madonna se mi manchi, sì, chiamatemi un medico
E poi senza avvisare sei qui

Oddio però tu mi piaci, oh-oh-oh
Ho fatto i salti mortali, oh-oh-oh
No, non mi dire che è tardi, ah-ah-ah
Avevo voglia di vo-voglia di, voglia di

Dove vai? Te ne vai
Quella volta non dovevi andare via
Ero bellissima, bellissima
Dove vai? Ma che cosa vuoi?
Quella volta ti aspettavo in Saint Laurent
Ero bellissima, bellissima, bellissima

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, bellissima
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, bellissima
Ah-ah-ah, ah, avevo voglia di
(Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah)

Avevo voglia di

Avevo voglia di, vo-voglia di, voglia di

Were the things you told me
And I almost disappeared
But you came to save me
Now you left me incomplete
And I′m searching for you
Another dawn is breaking through

I'm staring at the sun
And hope that you will come
I′m staring at the sun

Everything I used to know
Were the things you told me
And I almost disappeared
But you came to save me
I can see you in my dreams
I don't wanna wake up
Another dawn is breaking through

I'm staring at the sun
And hope that you will come
I′m walking all alone
And try to find my home
I′m staring at the sun

I'm staring at the sun
And hope that you will come

  {artist:"Dean Martin", title:"Dinah", text:`Dinah, is there anyone finer
In the state of Carolina
If there is and you know her
Show her to me
Dinah, with her Dixie eyes blazing
How I'd like to sit and gaze into the eyes of Dinah Lee

Every night why do I shake with fright
Because my Dinah might change her mind about me
Got to tell you about Dinah
If she went to China
I'd would hop an ocean liner
Just to be with Dinah Lee

Dinah, is there anyone finer
In the state of Carolina
If there is and you know her
Show her to me
Dinah, with her Dixie eyes blazing
How I'd like to sit and gaze into the eyes of Dinah Lee

I get my lovin′ in the evening time
When I'm with my baby

It's no fun with the sun around
But I get going when the sun goes down
And I meet my baby

That′s when we kiss and kiss and kiss
And then we kiss some more
Don′t ask how many times we kiss
At a time like this, who keeps score?

So I don't care if the sun don't shine
I get my lovin′ in the evening time

  {artist:"Helloween", title:"I Want Out", text:`From our lives beginning on
We are pushed in little forms
No one asks us how we like to be
In school they teach you what to think
But everyone says different things
But they're all convinced that
They're the ones to see

So they keep talking and they never stop
And at a certain point you give it up
So the only thing that's left to think is this

I want out
To live my life alone
I want out
leave me be
I want out
To do things on my own
I want out
To live my life and to be free

People tell me A and B
They tell me how I have to see
Things that I have seen already clear
So they push me then from side to side
They're pushing me from black to white
They're pushing 'til there's nothing more to hear

But don't push me to the maximum
Shut your mouth and take it home
Cause I decide the way things gonna be

I want out
To live my life alone
I want out
leave me be
I want out
To do things on my own
I want out
To live my life and to be free

There's a million ways to see the things in life
A million ways to be the fool
In the end of it, none of us is right
Sometimes we need to be alone

No, no, no, leave me alone

I want out
To live my life alone
I want out
leave me be
I want out
To do things on my own
I want out
To live my life and to be free

I want out!`, image:"IMG_7283.jpeg"},

  {artist:"NamNamBulu", title:"Memories", text:`All the things were going through
Let me know when it is over
I have never felt this way
I'm marked with scares that won't recover

I have always wanted you
Will I ever be returning
Now that I'm away from you
I feel the desperation's burning

The war has lasted for so long
We've all forgotten how it started
I don't remember right or wrong
I only know that we were parted

All the loving memories
All the time we spent together
It will stay for centuries
Our souls will last forever

I'll await the days ahead
To make sure that I'll be with you
And when the sky is turning red
Another day has past without you

I'll avenge for what I've missed
And no one will be trying to stop me
And if there's no one to assist
I'll still fight for memories of thee

I will always keep on me
Memories of what I wanted
What remains of what I see
Memories of what I wanted
I'll be trying to achieve
Memories of what I wanted
It is part of my belief
Memories of what I wanted`, image:"platzhalter8.jpg"},

10 seconds... 4... 3... 2... 1... Ignition and lift-off

There is a star
There is a star

There is a star, there is a star
There must be one
Whatever you wish it will be done
And if you believe the star's always shining
There is a star, there is a star

Star light, so bright. First star
I see tonight. Make me think about life
The meaning you and me, myself, I

Can you picture why
If your mind is strong, no matter what's going on
Believe in yourself and shine on
And the meaning is so clear to see
Understand the power then a life goes deep
Then a life goes deep

There is a star, there is a star
There must be one
Whatever you wish it will be done
And if you believe the star's always shining
There is a star, there is a star

Just let it go, but believe in you
Do what you want to do, with the limit true
Twinkle, twinkle see the star
Now believe in who you are
Cause all you want is a future of love and peace
Then everything is clear to see
The starting point is the star
Just believe in who you are

There is a star, there is a star
There must be one
Whatever you wish it will be done
And if you believe the star's always shining
There is a star, there is a star`, image:"platzhalter9.jpg"},

That keeps my faith alive tonight
You're gonna burn, there's no return
A fight to survive

There is no superman hero
There is no place where I can hide
It comes alive
The monster in me
In my body, in my head

I see you die
These demons are killing me
Right here - right now
It comes alive

I'm on attack
At war with the world
There's no surrender
No time to remember
I'm on attack
At war with the world
There's no surrender
I'm just the defender

I see you die
These demons are killing me
Right here - right now
It comes alive

I'm on attack
At war with the world
There's no surrender
No time to remember
I'm on attack
At war with the world
There's no surrender
I'm just the defender

  {artist:"Auger Feat. Bonnie Mavis", title:"Too Soon", text:`I bit my tongue but the words kept tryna reach you, what could I do?
There's something about the way it feels, with you
Every word and awkward conversation made it clear
There's something about the way it feels, with you

I'm standing in the doorway trying to be strong
I wanna say I love you but it feels wrong
I'm worried what'll happen next but I guess I'll wait
It's too soon to care but too late to change

Picture this, lying on the grass at sunset counting stars
I think about it all the time
But in my dream, I would turn to kiss you and you'd be gone
I think about it all the time

I'm standing in the doorway trying to be strong
I wanna say I love you but it feels wrong
I'm worried what'll happen next but I guеss I'll wait
It's too soon to care but too late to change

Too soon to carе but too late to change
Too soon to care but too late to change
I feel like this anxiety is pulling me in front of you
It's building up inside of me with everything I do
It's hard to think when air is thin, I breath in three and hold for two
I want you more than anything there's nothing I won't do

I'm standing in the doorway trying to be strong
I wanna say I love you but it feels wrong
I'm worried what'll happen next but I guess I'll wait
It's too soon to care but too late to change

Too soon to care but too late to change
Too soon to care but too late to change
