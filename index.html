C'è gente che ormai
Offre solo fobia
E ormai non si sa
Se avere pietà
O chiudersi il cuore
Qui l'impegno è un'idea
Si vive in apnea
Tra dubbi e rancore
È un viaggio nel peggio
Ma c'è chi dirà

Domani, domani
Finiscono i guai
Ci fanno promesse
Ma sempre le stesse
Domani, domani
Parola del mai
E intanto affonda
Lo stivale nel fango
Aspettando domani
Vedrai che domani

Qui si va sulla luna
Ma invece in tribuna
C'è chi rischia la pelle
Qui funziona il caffè
La mamma è ok
Ma poi tutto il resto?
Se giustizia è un'idea
Tu falla anche tua
Difendila sempre
Da chi ancora dirà
Le cose a metà

Domani, domani
Finiscono i guai
Ci fanno promesse
Ma sempre le stesse
Domani, domani
Parola del mai
E intanto affonda
Lo stivale nel fango
Aspettando domani
Vedrai che domani

Ma sul pozzo del tempo
Ai piedi del monte aspetterò
Per stringere tra le mie mani
Un nuovo domani

Domani, domani
Nel sole verrà
La voce di un uomo
Dimenticato
Domani, domani
Più giusto sarà
Il mondo avrà il cuore
Che hai sempre sognato

Aspetta domani
Domani, domani
Soltanto domani
Domani, domani`

Now this is long ago,
but today I′m really sure,
I don't wanna crawl no more.
No, I don′t want to!

I want to be all alone
to be all alone
(leave me all alone, I'm so lonely)
Sometimes I don′t know what I prefer to be
(that's all that I can see)

So I burnt down the house of hate,
the key to close the door,
what a nice September,
I found out it′s not too late.

It happened yesterday,
but today I'm really sure,
I don't wanna crawl no more.

Mettiamo un po' di musica da ginnastica
È tutto il giorno che mi salvo da un pianto isterico
Vado a letto col pantaloncino dell'Adidas

We are pushed in little forms
No one asks us how we like to be
In school they teach you what to think
But everyone says different things
But they're all convinced that
They're the ones to see

So they keep talking and they never stop
And at a certain point you give it up
So the only thing that's left to think is this

I want out
To live my life alone
I want out
leave me be
I want out
To do things on my own
I want out
To live my life and to be free

People tell me A and B
They tell me how I have to see
Things that I have seen already clear
So they push me then from side to side
They're pushing me from black to white
They're pushing 'til there's nothing more to hear

But don't push me to the maximum
Shut your mouth and take it home
Cause I decide the way things gonna be

I want out
To live my life alone
I want out
leave me be
I want out
To do things on my own
I want out
To live my life and to be free

There's a million ways to see the things in life
A million ways to be the fool
In the end of it, none of us is right
Sometimes we need to be alone

No, no, no, leave me alone

I want out
To live my life alone
I want out
leave me be
I want out
To do things on my own
I want out
To live my life and to be free

All the time we spent together
It will stay for centuries
Our souls will last forever

I'll await the days ahead
To make sure that I'll be with you
And when the sky is turning red
Another day has past without you

I'll avenge for what I've missed
And no one will be trying to stop me
And if there's no one to assist
I'll still fight for memories of thee

I just want to walk through fading waves

Can‘t moving on
Can‘t moving on

Hope and faith are buried, ghosts in chains
All my gods have turned away, no time
There is no pray and I don't lose a game
I would like to save a life – mine

Seasons drowned in flood of tears
Sorrow on a broken shore

I just want to walk through fading waves
I just want to walk through fading waves
And past the ocean‘s haze
Change these dying days
I just want to walk through fading waves

fading waves`

Because the world is just a figment of the fools
A blank stare, they don't care

But I've been seen with Farrah
I've never been with anything less than a nine

gone fast with a girl named Bo
But somehow they just don't end up as mine

It's a death-defying life I lead
I'll take my chances
I've died for a living in the movies and tv
But the hardest thing I ever do
Is watch my leading ladies
Kiss some other guy while I'm bandaging my knee

I might fall from a tall building
I might roll a brand-new car
'Cause I'm the unknown stuntman
That made Redford
such a star

I've never spent much time in school
But I taught ladies plenty
It's true I hire my body out for pay
Hey hey!
I've gotten burned over Cheryl Tiegs
Blown up over Raquel Welch
But when I wind up in the hay, it's only hay,
Hey hey!

I might jump an open drawbridge
Or Tarzan from a vine
'Cause I'm the unknown stuntman
That makes Eastwood
look so fine

They'll never make me president
But I got the best first ladies
Some days I got 'em as far as the eye can see
Oo-wee
A morning drive with Jackie Smith
A crash in the night with Cheryl
But in the end they never stay with me

(Chorus 3)
I might fall from a tall building
So Burt Reynolds don't get hurt
I might leap a mighty canyon
So he can kiss and flirt
While that smooth talker's kissing my girl
I'm just kissing dirt
Yes, I'm the lonely stuntman
That made a lover out of Burt`
